# Text Editor Frontend - Vue.js

This repository is a part of the course JSRamverk at Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH).
All supporting development work, examples and course guidance is provided by [Emil Folino](https://github.com/emilfolino?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=me-&type=&language=) of the faculty [DBWebb-team](https://dbwebb.se/).  

In this part of the course we will examine and choose a framwork for JavaScript to work with.
As a starting point we are taking a look at a few different frameworks including the big three [Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) & [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/) to compare with vanilla JavaScript.
From this we evaluate and choose a framework to work with and for this repository I've chosen Vue.JS.  

This is the first part of the course and here we learn the basics of building a frontend application.
