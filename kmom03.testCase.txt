Test cases for frontend (use cases)

These are ideas for test cases:
1. Can the user navigate to the text editor?                        Yes
2. Is the input of the form valid?                                  Yes
3. Can the user open a document from the list of documents?         Yes
4. Can the user create a new document?                              Yes
