Test cases for frontend (use cases)

These are ideas for test cases:
1. Can the user navigate to the text editor?                        Yes
2. Can the user create a new document while at the text editor?     No, test for it!
3. Can the user open a document from the list of documents?         No, test for it!
4. Can a user save a updated document?                              No, test for it!
5. Can the user delete a document from the list of documents?       No, test for it!


If this was a enterprise application.
* The most important stuff:
1. Can the user login?                                              No, test for it!
2. Can the user place/pay for an order?                             No, test for it!

* The other stuff:
Navigational functionality.
CRUD stuff..
