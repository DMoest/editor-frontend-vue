Test cases for frontend (use cases)

These are ideas for test cases:
1. Can the user navigate to the text editor?
2. Can the user create a new document while at the text editor?
3. Can the user open a document from the list of documents?
4. Can a user save a updated document?
5. Can the user delete a document from the list of documents?


If this was a enterprise application.
* The most important stuff:
1. Can the user login?
2. Can the user place/pay for an order?

* The other stuff:
Navigational functionality.
CRUD stuff..
